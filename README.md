# BridgeLabz-Training
16 December

Focus: Introduction & Git Setup
Introduction to Java training, creating folders, setting up a Git repository, understanding local and remote repositories, and making the first commit on GitHub.

17 December

Focus: Java Basics & Git
Learned Java basics like program structure, variables, data types, operators, taking input using Scanner, compiling and running Java programs, and using basic Git commands such as git status, git add, git commit, and git push.

18 December

Focus: Programming Practice
Solved Java programs based on arithmetic calculations, conditions, user input, operator order, type conversion, and better code writing.

19 December

Focus: Core Java Concepts
Studied core Java topics like classes, objects, methods, static keyword, and basic object-oriented concepts with practice programs.

20 December

Focus: Coding & Real-Life Problems
Worked on coding questions and real-life based problems to improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

22 December

Focus: This project focuses on practicing Core Java concepts such as strings, arrays, logic building, and exception handling. It includes topics like string comparison, null pointer exceptions, string and array index out-of-bounds exceptions, number format exceptions, converting uppercase to lowercase and lowercase to uppercase without using built-in string methods.

23 December

Focus: A collection of Core Java practice programs focusing on strings, arrays, and logic building. The programs include palindrome, anagram, character frequency, BMI calculator, calendar display, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and student grade calculation, all written using simple loops, arrays, and methods.

24 December

Focus: Practiced Java methods a lot. Learned how to write reusable code and how to break a big problem into small functions. Solved programs like finding the smallest and largest number, calculating wind chill, using trigonometric functions, displaying a calendar, and finding the sum of natural numbers.

26 December

Focus: Practiced Java programs mainly focused on strings and methods. Solved problems such as counting vowels and consonants, removing duplicate characters, finding the longest word, checking substring occurrences, and toggling the case of characters. Gained better understanding of method creation, loops, and writing clean and modular code. This practice improved problem-solving skills and strengthened string manipulation concepts in Core Java.

29 December (Monday)

Practiced Core Java programs covering control statements, loops, and switch-case through real-world problems like Employee Wage Computation, Movie Ticket Booking, Library Fine Calculator, Digital Watch Simulation, and Fitness Tracker. Implemented logic using if-else, for/while loops, break/continue, and Math.random(). Focused on writing simple, clean, and modular code with proper variable usage. Strengthened problem-solving skills and understanding of Core Java fundamentals.

30 December (Tuesday)

Practiced Core Java programs focused on classes, methods, and control structures, including Employee Wage Computation, line comparision and snack and ladder programs. Implemented logic using loops, switch-case, random attendance checks, and conditional wage calculations. Worked on method creation, modular code structure, and use of class variables and objects. Enhanced understanding of real-world problem solving, Core Java fundamentals, and basic Git workflow concepts.
